This blog site is an effort by me to give back to the data science community what I am learning from various sources. The site's code was forked by me from sharu725's github's page and I am just using the code base as a medium to publish my blogs and am really grateful for sharu to have shared the code on the public repository.

Hi, I am Ashmin and this is my blog on data science. Currently studying my Masters in Syracuse University, I seek a career in Data Science and Data Analytics field. 

This blog might help upcoming data scientists to learn new things while helping me capture useful things I am learning everyday.
